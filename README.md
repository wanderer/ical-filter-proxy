## What's this thing?

Do you have iCal feeds with a bunch of stuff you _don't_ need? Do you want to modify events generated by your rostering system?

iCal Filter Proxy is a simple service for proxying multiple iCal feeds while applying a list of filters to remove or modify events to suit your use case.

### Features

- Proxy multiple calendars
- Define a list of filters per calendar
- Match events using basic text and regex conditions
- Remove or modify events as they are proxied

### Built With

- Go
- [golang-ical](https://github.com/arran4/golang-ical)
- [yaml.v3](https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/tree/v3.0.1)
- [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-2/) (app icon)

## Setup

### Docker

Docker images are published to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/yungwood/ical-filter-proxy). You'll need a config file (see below) mounted into the container at `/app/config.yaml`.

For example:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=ical-filter-proxy \
  -v config.yaml:/app/config.yaml \
  -p 8080:8080/tcp \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  yungwood/ical-filter-proxy:latest
```

You can also adapt the included [`docker-compose.yaml`](./docker-compose.yaml) example.

### Kubernetes

You can deploy iCal Filter Proxy using the helm chart from [`yungwood/helm-charts/ical-filter-proxy`](https://github.com/yungwood/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/ical-filter-proxy).

```bash
helm repo add yungwood https://yungwood.github.io/helm-charts/
helm install --name your-release yungwood/ical-filter-proxy
```

### Build from source

You can also build the app and container from source.

```bash
# clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:yungwood/ical-filter-proxy.git
cd ical-filter-proxy

# build container image
docker build -t ical-filter-proxy:latest .
```

### Nix Flake

If you use Nix, you can build and run the application using the provided flake:

```bash
cd ical-filter-proxy

# build the application
nix build

# run the application
nix run . -- --help

# enter development shell with Go toolchain
nix develop

# run directly from GitHub
nix run github:yungwood/ical-filter-proxy -- --help
```


## Configuration

Calendars and filters are defined in a yaml config file. By default this is `config.yaml` (use the `-config` switch to change this). The configuration must define at least one calendar for ical-filter-proxy to start.

Example configuration (with comments):

```yaml
calendars:
  # basic example
  - name: example # used as slug in URL - e.g. ical-filter-proxy:8080/calendars/example/feed?token=changeme
    publish_name: "My Calendar" # the published name of the calendar - uses upstream value if this line is skipped
    token: "changeme" # optional - token must be used to pull iCal feed if defined
    public: false # optional - must be true if token is blank or not defined
    feed_url: "https://my-upstream-calendar.url/feed.ics" # URL for the upstream iCal feed
    filters: # optional - if no filters defined the upstream calendar is proxied as parsed
      - description: "Remove an event based on a regex"
        remove: true # events matching this filter will be removed
        match: # optional - all events will match if no rules defined
          summary: # match on event summary (title)
            contains: "deleteme" # must contain 'deleteme'
      - description: "Remove descriptions from all events"
        transform: # optional
          description: # modify event description
            remove: true # replace with a blank string

  # example: removing noise from an Office 365 calendar
  - name: outlook
    token: "changeme"
    feed_url: "https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/.../reachcalendar.ics"
    filters:
      - description: "Remove canceled events" # canceled events remain with a 'Canceled:' prefix until removed
        remove: true
        match:
          summary:
            prefix: "Canceled: "
      - description: "Remove events without descriptions"
        remove: true
        match:
          description:
            empty: true
      - description: "Remove public holidays"
        remove: true
        match:
          summary:
            regex: ".*[Pp]ublic [Hh]oliday.*"

  # example: cleaning up an OpsGenie feed
  - name: opsgenie
    token: "changeme"
    feed_url: "https://company.app.opsgenie.com/webapi/webcal/getRecentSchedule?webcalToken=..."
    filters:
      - description: "Keep oncall schedule events and fix names"
        match:
          summary:
            contains: "schedule: oncall"
        stop: true # stops processing any more filters
        transform:
          summary:
            replace: "On-Call" # replace the event summary (title)
      - description: "Remove all other events"
        remove: true
```

### Filters

Calendar events are filtered using a similar concept to email filtering. A list of filters is defined for each calendar in the config.

Each event parsed from `feed_url` is evaluated against the filters in sequence.

- All `match` rules for a filter must be true to match an event
- A filter with no `match` rules will _always_ match
- When a match is found:
  - if `remove` is `true` the event is discarded
  - `transform` rules are applied to the event
  - if `stop` is `true` no more filters are processed
- If no match is found the event is retained by default

#### Match conditions

Each filter can specify match conditions against the following event properties:

- `summary` (string value)
- `location` (string value)
- `description` (string value)
- `url` (string value)

These match conditions are available for a string value:

- `empty` - if `true`, property must be absent or empty
- `contains` - property must contain this value
- `prefix` - property must start with this value
- `suffix` - property must end with this value
- `regex` - property must match the given regular expression (an invalid regex will result in no matches)

#### Transformations

Transformations can be applied to the following event properties:

- `summary` - string value
- `location` - string value
- `description` - string value
- `url` - string value

The following transformations are available for strings:

- `replace` - the property is replace with this value
- `remove` - if `true` the property is set to a blank string

### Secrets

You can load `feed_url` and `token` values from files by specifying the `feed_url_file` and `token_file` fields in the calendar configuration. When these fields are set, any values directly provided for `feed_url` or `token` are ignored.

For example:

```yaml
calendars:
  - name: example
    token_file: "/run/secrets/outlook-token"
    feed_url_file: "/run/secrets/outlook-feed"
```

## Roadmap to 1.0

There are a few more features I would like to add before I call the project "stable" and release version 1.0.

- [ ] Time based event conditions
- [ ] Caching
- [ ] Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Testing

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by [darkphnx/ical-filter-proxy](https://github.com/darkphnx/ical-filter-proxy). I needed more flexibility with filtering rules and the ability to modify event descriptions... plus I wanted an excuse to finally write something in Go.
